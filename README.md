"This game was developed for a one-week game jam during my fourth week of bootcamp, in collaboration with four colleagues. We were all beginners in programming and worked together outside of regular working hours. While we are proud of the quality of gameplay, we recognize that the code reflects our inexperience and the urgency to deliver on time.

In the future, I plan to rewrite it with more time and experience, aiming to achieve the same gameplay but with code that adheres to best programming practices."
